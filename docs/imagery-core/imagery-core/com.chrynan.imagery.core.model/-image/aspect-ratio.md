val [aspectRatio](aspect-ratio.md): [Float](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-float/index.html)?

The aspect ratio of the image. This value should always be the width of the image divided by the height of the image regardless of which side is larger or what orientation the image is in.
